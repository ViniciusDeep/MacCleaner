# MacCleaner  

MacCleaner is an open-source macOS application designed to clean up and optimize your system by removing temporary files, caches, and other unnecessary data.

## About

MacCleaner is an open-source project created by me. As a busy and lazy person, I often forget to clean up my Mac until the storage is full. That's why I created this software to automate the process and keep my Mac clean and optimized.

## Features

- **System Cleanup**: Remove temporary files, caches, and other unnecessary data to free up disk space.
- **Large & Old Files Finder**: Identify large and old files on your system for easy cleanup.
- **Developer Tools Cache Cleanup**: Remove Xcode, VSCode, and other developer tools cache files.
- **Dashboard**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage with real-time graphs.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use interface for effortless system cleanup.
